# Jail-Break-Game

<h2>How to play</h2>
<h3>Online</h3>
You can play the game through its itch.io page here:
<h3>Windows/Linux</h3>
Simply download the latest release for your platform and run the executable within
<h3>Other</h3>
This game can run on any platform that supports Raylib (And there are a lot of them!). For these platforms, download the source and follow instructions at the Raylib website () to build for that platform - You will need to borrow a Makefile from a Raylib example/template depending on your development environment and target. 

<h2>Build Tests</h2>

| Development Environment | Target | Success |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Windows | Windows_64 (.exe) | y |
|  | HTML 5 | y |
| Linux (Ubuntu) | Linux | y |


<h2>Contrubuting</h2>
Any help is much appreciated, especially when it comes to making this game available on as many platforms as possible.
